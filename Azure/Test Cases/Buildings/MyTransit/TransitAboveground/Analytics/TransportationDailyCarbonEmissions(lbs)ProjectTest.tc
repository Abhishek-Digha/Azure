   <description>Daily based carbon emission generated by commuters to the project by
transport modes.
Formulae:
Daily carbon emissions = Avg(carbon emission generateed) * (2 * assets’s occupancy)
Avg carbon emissions => Mean (total carbon emissions generated)
=> Sum(carbon emission generated)/total no of survey submitted
where, total no of survey = (Survey response rate (in %)/100)* (asset’s occupancy) # You can memorise as
well.
Sum(carbon emission generated) = Sum(total Sum(each transport mode) * respective carbon factor)</description>
